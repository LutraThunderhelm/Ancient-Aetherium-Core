{{Gredo|Gredo's}} social power structure is divided among 7 groups, known as the 7 {{Social Rung|Rungs}} of its strict {{Social Ladder|Social Ladder}}. Ranging from lawmakers to workers, this social caste is the main source of segregation and discrimination present within {{Gredo|Gredo's}} social system. These social groups cause physical and cultural divides among {{Gredo|Gredo's}} large population, along with much social unrest. Violence stemming from the class divide is not uncommon in lower {{Social Rung|Rung}} communities, however, class warfare itself is extremely rare. Labeled as {{Riot|Riots}}, lower Rung uprisings and higher {{Social Rung|Rung}} takeovers are extremely rare for a single reason: Power through Unity. {{Gredo|Gredo's}} only form of social tape to prevent constant {{Riot|Riots}} is the idea that any kind of fractured {{Gredo|Gredo}} will be incapable of withstanding the attacks of their {{Hive|eternal enemy}}, which causes the lower {{Social Rung|Rungs}} to cooperate out of fear, and keeps the higher {{Social Rung|Rungs}} from provoking a coup.

During roleplay, your social {{Social Rung|Rung}} will be extremely important. Characters can be from the {{Social Rung|Rungs}} of the {{Royals|Royals}}, {{Nobles|Nobles}}, {{Guilds|Guilds}}, {{Military Rung|Military}}, {{Citizens|Citizens}}, {{Residents|Residents}}, and {{Workers|Workers}}. Should your character neglect the social structure of {{Gredo|Gredo}} entirely, they may become a {{Traitors|Traitor}} to {{Gredo|Gredo}}. {{Traitors|Traitors}} are an 8th {{Social Rung|Rung}} that exists as a category for the revolutionary groups that operate outside of {{Gredo|Gredo's}} social and political structures for various reasons. Additionally, there is no easy way to hide a character's {{Social Rung|Rung}}. {{Social Rung|Rungs}} themselves tend to be very culturally diverse, giving their members small and unbreakable habits that give away their standing. (subtle accents, word choice, walking pattern, posture, presence, etc.).
