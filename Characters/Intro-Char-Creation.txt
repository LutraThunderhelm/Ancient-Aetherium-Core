Making a character may seem daunting at first, but by following a specific list of steps, you're character can be created easily and quickly. Bears are comprised of 7 parts: Social Rung, Backgrounds, Skills and Traits, Deteriments, and lastly Perks, Arcana, and Gear. To get started, open the next page in a new tab and reference this list to create a character. This list assumes you have a copy of the character sheet already, found here.

Firstly, find a Social Rung for your character. They may be anything from an academic Royal to a rebellious Resident. This Social Rung will effect every social encounter this character has, so its a good idea to take a moment to pick the right Rung for you. Once a Rung has been decided on, write it down under the RUNG section of your character sheet.

Next is your characters Backgrounds. Backgrounds represent the experiences they've gained upon entering the real world beyond creation. Backgrounds tend to be a product of the characters enviroment and decide how easy it is to gain related Perks later on. Once 2 Backgrounds have been picked, note them in the 2 BACKGROUND sections of your character sheet.

Next comes the character's Skills and Traits, or what your character is capable of. During character creation the XP tables may be ignored, instead gain 5 Levels to spread among Traits. Any Trait may recieve any amount of these levels, such as giving the Handling Trait 1 Level and the Vitality Trait 3 Levels. Additionally, gain 30 Skill Levels to spread among Skills. Any Skill may recieve any amount of these levels. Once the characters Skills and Traits have been decided, note them down on your character sheet by shading in a box next to the name of the Skill or Trait for every level invested into it.

Finally comes the character's Detriments, or their flaws. Upon character creation only 3 Detriments may be taken, however more may be gained after character creation. For every Detriment obtained by your character, add its Reward XP to the Total XP value at the bottom of the character sheet. Upon taking up to 3 Detriments the creation part of your character is complete, but your character isn't done.

Promotion is the act of spending XP and Artifact ($A) on new Skill and Trait Levels, new Perks, new Spells, and new Gear. All freshly created Bears are given an additional 1000 XP to spend on Promotion, and 2000 Artifact ($A) to spend on Gear.
