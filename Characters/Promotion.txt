When Bears travel through the Ancient Aetherium they gain new skills and abilities over time based on what they've learned during their adventures. As a character moves through the world they will gain XP when the RM feels the party has made progress. This XP may be spent to increase the power of the character by letting them learn new Perks, gain new Skills, or take new Spells. Through out the Ancient Aetherium System, many things will have an XP cost attached, such as a Perk with an XP cost of 500. When that Perk or any other item with an XP cost is taken, that XP is lost permanently and the Perk or other ability is gained.

It is suggested to keep track of the amount of XP that has been spent by characters over time, so that if a new character enters into the group, they may be given an amount of XP that is close to the rest of the group to build their character with after character creation.
