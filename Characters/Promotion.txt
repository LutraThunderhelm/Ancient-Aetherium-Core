When Bears travel through the Ancient Aetherium they gain new skills and abilities over time based on what they've learned during their adventures. As a character moves through the world they will gain Levels after important events. Levels are handed out by the RM after significant events, and give the character a way of growing both as a person, and in mechanical power. Gaining a Level is known as Promotion, and allows a character to do one of four different things.

During a Promotion a character may increase their power by gaining new Skill Levels, lowering their Trait Levels, gaining new Spells, or gaining new Perks. Doing so uses Promotion perminately, preventing it from being used on more than one of those things at a time. While promotions are temporary, Levels are permanent, allowing you to keep track of how powerful your character has become, and allowing them to gain access to new Perks over time.

Promotions may specifically gain: distributing 3 new Skill Levels, lowering 1 Trait Level, 2 new Spells, or 1 new Perk.
