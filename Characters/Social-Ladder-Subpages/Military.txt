Few know what it means to leave Gredo's guarded borders, and fewer still knows the stench of death that lingers over a Field of Ash. Gredo's Military Rung is comprised of the most expendable as well as the most highly trained combatants who are sent to fight the front lines against the Hive. Dedicated to the Eternal War, Soldiers find themselves facing incredible odds and horrid conditions from every da, fighting for every bitter piece of progress they can.

Those in Gredo's Military are familiar with many types of combat in many different conditions. From the cracked dirt in an old park, to the fuzzy corpses of what were once friends, nothing in the Ruins is new to them anymore. Fighting through crumbling streets and collapsing buildings, the Military is split into specialist divisions to fight with guerilla tactics, which are sent to respective battlefields to hold order and take land in an ever living fight to reach the Hive. Additionally, these groups need to work quickly. Temporary Outposts are setup for the night, a time respected by both the Hive and Gredo's own Military as belonging to the Night Terrors. Land is gained and lost between both sides in 24 hour cycles, leaving little time to entrench themselves into any one location.

Fighting for ones own life on a daily basis and losing friends faster than you can count takes a toll on those who experience it. Members of Gredo's Military often find themselves socially and emotionally challenged by the perils of a safe life within the Gredo's walls. Dejected, yet respected, Soldiers will find themselves often unable to fully fit back in with the Rungs they once left for the chaos of the Ruins, leading them to return to the battlefield. Should they resist this call though, they may struggle to form connections like they once did, despite the immense respect from the Rungs in Gredo's Walls.
