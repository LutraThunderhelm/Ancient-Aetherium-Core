Making up the enterprising sector, Guilds are the large private groups run in Gredo. Found in the Middle Triad, Guilds are large compounds that provide all the resources needed for function, and its members. From these compounds Guilds provide a private alternative to their Noble counterparts, often being the only option for some fields. Royals wouldn't create a Nobility under the pretense of providing guns for hire, but the Scouts Guild will line you up with a private militia in a heartbeat.

The first Guilds were small groups of specialists looking for a place to combine their talents that converted old Population Compounds into glorified club houses. These small groups started getting commissioned by Citizens for their talents, giving rise to a new private sector. This private sector explodeded in popularity shortly after the creation of the Scouts Guild, bringing a new gold paved age into Gredo. Standardizing the trade of goods by the way of the Guilded Merchants, they even created a new currency made of coal plated in gold to hijack the current Artifact trading market.

Now on top of the world sitting in golden thrones, the Guilds have become the ultimate centers of trade and services, providing to the Royals, Residents, and everyone in between. If you've got the money, you can get anything done through the right Guild. Those in the Guilded Rung can expect great respect from those around them for the work they do, but, they must also keep track of their responsibilities. Guild members are greatly compensated for their work, as long as the work gets done. Should a member of the Guilds fail to assist the Guild they are a part of, they may be removed entirely from the Guilded Rung.
