The Rung of many with the culture of none, The Citizens make up Gredo's reserve population. Held as the largest Rung, the Citizenship of Gredo's City is found in the Lower Triad, packed densely into stonework houses and old world buildings. The job of these Citizens is simple; to be ready to be picked at any time and moved to a different Rung. Should a Nobility lose members, an Outpost need Residents, the Worker's Bastion be empty, or the Military hit too hard, the Citizens will make up the replacements.

Overseen by several Nobilities, becoming a Citizen is typically seen as a transitional state between Rungs. Despite this, many Citizens have not moved Rungs since their creation, waiting for the day they get assigned somewhere new. Citizens don't sit idle however. The Lowest Triad is filled with resources to keep Citizens sharp, and to train them for new assignment should they get picked. Filled with schools, markets, bars, training grounds, repair yards, dueling arenas, and more, Citizens will never find themselves without something to improve upon. Citizens who fail to use their resources at a reasonable rate will typically be the first put in harms way, being assigned to the Military as connon fodder, the Working Rung to make up for their laziness, or the Residential Rung where its impossible to slack off.

The Citizens also make up the Rung of recovery for all other Rungs, being the natural Rung to flow back to. When a Royal no longer wishes to work in their Office, a Resident no longer able to keep up in their Outpost, or a Military member being too emotionally scarred to keep fighting, they get reassigned as a Citizen. For some this becomes a transition to a new life, but for others it becomes a way to retire from the constant stress of the Rungs around them, as long as they stay active in their training. Those who retire to being a Citizen are typically last to be called upon for reassignment unless absolutely necessary.
