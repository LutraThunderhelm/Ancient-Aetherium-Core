Existing as an outsider of the Social Ladder, Traitors have foresaken Gredo, its government, and its people for any reason. Traitors are not one single group, instead existing as many divisions of bear like beings who work against Gredo for one reason or another. Ranging from bandits that hijack trainlines for profit, or engineers working directly against Gredo's social taboos, the motivations of these groups can range from wanting to violently fix Grdedo's problems, to breaking cutstom, to abandoning Gredo and everyone in it entirely.

Traitors always come from somewhere however. Unable to leave Gredo for good due to its overarching power, Traitors instead must use their original Rung as cover to breach the social order. Shifting among the Rungs as ghosts of their former roles, Traitors take no part in any group of their previous Rung, instead belonging to a Traitorous Party. These Parties will often have hidden goals and important agendas Traitors will need to follow, such as turning over any and all important paperwork, or snagging artifacts from Gredo's merchants. This may become an issue for the Traitor and the other players if not handled carefully, as the Traitor Player Character may end up working against the group and causing conflict. RMs are suggested to work with Traitors, if they allow them, to make the game fun for all their players.
