The core of the Ancient Aetherium is comprised of characters and their parts. These characters carry the story and the adventure decided by the players and controlled by the RM. These characters come from the City of Gredo, a place of magic, wonder, and civil disruptions. Gredo is a faction of living Teddy Bears lead by a religiously powerful leader, and a society split into a 7 Rung caste system. Players will take control of one of these Bears and take them through the world as they encounter the Nausea, the Hive, and other Bears.
