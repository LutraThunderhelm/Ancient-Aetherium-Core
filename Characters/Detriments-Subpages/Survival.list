Bound to Oblivion
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Reward: 3
Some of those who wander the old crumbling streets of the Ancient Aetherium don't do it out of motivation for survival. Those who are Bound to Oblivion have a greater goal they wish to achieve, whether that be avenging a murdered friend, or dismantling a group of Corrupt Nobles. To complete their goal they will do anything and everything in their power, including throwing away their own life if it means there's a chance of success. Those who are Bound to Oblivion don't become suicidal, but they lose most of their self preservation.

Dependancy

Reward: 3
Those with a Dependency need an additional item to survive, or otherwise be punished. Dependencies can be anything from Brews, to the gas found in the Nauseas, to steam cores. Every 4 hours spent without the Dependency will cause your character to replace a D10 with a D8 in their Skill Check dice pools.

Phobia

Reward: 2
Many things are reasonably scary, such as night terrors and battlefields, but Phobias cover things that make a little less sense. Due to something that may have harmed your character, they have a fear of a typically normal thing. Phobias can be anything from being submerged in water to Nauseous Spiders. When in contact with a Phobia, make a Fear Check.

Voices

Reward: 2
Sanity is not required to function for the bears of Gredo. Those who hear Voices will often be seen talking to themselves and arguing to the air should they acknowledge them. If one ignores the voices they will often miss when others try to communicate with them. Additionally, at the start of every session roll a Sanity Skill Check with a Difficulty of 2. A success means the voices do not get the best of you. If you fail the voices are able to convince your character to do things they otherwise would not.

Weak Soul

Reward: 2
The creatures that strike fear in the hearts of many are especially terrifying to those with a Weak Soul. When your character fails a fear check, draw two cards and take the worst of the two.
