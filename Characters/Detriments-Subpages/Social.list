Naive
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Reward: 2
The Ruins aren't that bad, and Gredo's Royals and Nobles can handle this war no problem! Those who are Naive turn a blind eye to the suffering and despair of the world, whether its purposeful or obliviousness is decided by the character.

Obligation
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Reward: 3
While many can leave their post and work odd jobs, many others are not so lucky. Obligations are tasks that are required of your character, and will often pull them away from adventuring to complete. Obligations can be anything from writing for ones Royal Office, to keeping a promise to a friend, to make it gambling night every few days.

Rebellious
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Reward: 2
Trust no one with power, there's only one way they got it. Those in positions of power should have a thing or two taught to them, but sadly that must wait until the war is no longer threatening the survival of all. Those with Rebellious think like this, and oftentimes end up acting on it. 

Stubborn
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Reward: 1
Your character knows what's best, and can't be convinced otherwise. Those who are Stubborn never let an idea or way of thinking go, fighting tooth and nail to do it their way.

Tongue Tied
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Reward: 1
Some find talking difficult, tripping over their words or developing a stutter. Those with Tongue-Tied have a quirk while speaking that makes it harder for others to understand them. Your character acts as though they have 1 less level in Persuasion than they do.

Vow
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Reward: 2
Vows are promises made by a character that they can never break. Vows typically have an emotional investment to a character, but contractual Vows are also possible. While Vows and Faith are similar, you cannot take both an Oath/Promise and Vow for the same thing. Promising to never abandon a friend while taking the Oath of Protection will not result in a reward and faith bonus, it will only result in a faith bonus.
