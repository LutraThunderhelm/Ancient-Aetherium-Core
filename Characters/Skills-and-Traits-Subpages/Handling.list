Acrobatics

Being a raw measurement of elegance and flexability, Acrobatics represents a characters physical finesse as they move. Characterized by being nimble, quick, or having complex movement, Skill Checks against Acrobratics will test your characters control over their Husk. This comes up commonly in situations such as jumping between rail cars, making complex combat maneuvers, or navigating dangerous terrain.

Firing

Ranged weapons such as crossbows and boomsticks require a steady and firm form. Firing is ones ability to control their body to make consistantly well place shots with any manor of ranged weapon. Firing is tested most during active combat, requiring quick reactions against aggressive enemies, but those with a high Firing can easily take on that challenge.

Deflection

It takes a special understanding of your own movement to alter the flow of combat. Deflection is the ability to redirect damage away from your self upon being attacked. This can be redirected away to dodge, redirected into a weapon, or even reversed back onto the attacker. Skill Checks involving Deflection appear most commonly in combat, but they can also be used to defend yourself against suprise damage, such as traps.

Brawling

Up close and personal weapons, such as axes and swords, require strong from and reflexive movement. Brawling is the ability of a character to control their body and their weapons to bring destruction upon others. Using ones weapons as extentions of their own limbs, or just relying on their own hands, those with a higher Brawling skill are a force to be reckoned with. Brawling is most often seen during combat.

Evade

Evade, unlike the other Handling Skills, is not rolled during Skill Checks. Evade is a single number that dictates how hard it is to pin down and hit your character. Wild motions and hastey movements can make your character harder to target and harder to hit, effecting their Evade score. This is used most often in combat, where enemies will have to rival your Evade level with their own Brawling or Firing Skill.
