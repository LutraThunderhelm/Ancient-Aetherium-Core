Gredo is a complex web of class strugles, inner politics, and hidden goals, making the navigation of its torn social fabric a trait unto itself. The Social Trait is a characters ability to navigate, mess with, or dominate those around them through nothing but words and action. With conversations commonly taking place between those with different backgrounds, social standings, power, and experience, its easy to shift the view of your character and their group using any number of Social Skills.

Additionally, social Skills are not all conversation. Social skills such as Schema and Performance are much more reflective of your characters ability to understand and dominate the social fabric through action and memory, without needing to watch their words. Social Skills are broken up into 5 distinct skills: Insight, Persuasion, Schema, Presence, and Performance.
