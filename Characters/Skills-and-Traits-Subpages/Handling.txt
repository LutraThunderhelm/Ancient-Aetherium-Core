 The ability to move your husk with grace is not one that comes naturally. Handling is a measure of a character's ability to control their husk and body, letting those with higher Handling make elegant and complex movements more easily. Handling covers 4 skills: Acrobatics, Firing, Brawling, and Deflection.
 
 Handling has an additional score called Evade, which is much more passive than a skill. The effects of Evade are applied when taking damage, meaning that your Handling score plays a different role with your Evade score, acting as a guard. At Handling Level 7 effects that target your evade score cannot remove more than 4 Evade. At Handling Level 6 this bonus becomes half of your Evade score rounded down, and at Level 5 the bonus only allow you to lose up to 1 point of Evade.
