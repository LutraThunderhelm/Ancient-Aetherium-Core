Operation

Knowing what those shiny buttons and levers do is a powerful tool to have in Gredo. Operation is your characters ability to understand and use equipment or machinery, with more outlandish and exotic mechanisms requiring a higher level of Operation to use consistantly. Operation can cover any device from powered weapons, to human machines, to hive factories.

Academics

Put simply, your Academic Skill is how much your character knows of traditional scientific fields. Topics such as engineering, chemistry, and physics are often learned after creation through special schooling, or discovering some of the sciences yourself. Characters with a higher Academic skill will tend to understand more complex sciences than their peers.

History

The world around you is a wealth of knowledge waiting to be tapped. The History Skill taps into that wealth of knowledge, allowing your character to recall major historical events of any era, including human eras. Historical knowledge itself is not common, and must be learned through specific nobilities, guilds, or story tellers making keeping track of everything a skill unto itself.

Creation

Common among the arts and the battlefield alike, Creation is your characters ability to diviate from the standard. Representing ones creativity, Creation is often used to think outside the box, coming up with new solutions and unique ideas on the spot. Creation itself can be applied to any medium, whether its dreaming up new songs, new inventions, or new strategies.

Process

Process is your characters raw ability to crunch numbers. Solving straight forward yet complex problems, putting clues together, or simply applying rigorous reasoning, all fall under your characters ability to Process information. Process itself is a catch-all skill for raw cognitive function, however its role as your characters raw ability to reason should not be underestimated.
