Stand with your back straight and your head clear at the end of the world. Bravery is a measure of mental resistance to terrifying situations, letting your character remain calm and collected with faced with horrific scenarios. Bravery will most often come up in situations that play on realistic fears, such as fear of death or fear of the night, never letting your character stand down to the challenge.

Brawn

Brawn is a measure of pure physical might. Husks can be pushed to their limits and beyond by those with enough willpower to do so, and Brawn is a measure of that willpower. Typically called on when making strength based checks such as lifting heavy cargo or breaking down a door, Brawn can be seen as an equivalent to a characters raw strength.

Sanity

Measuring mental fortitude, Sanity holds your characters mind straight in the face of something unreal. Gredo is full of strong mental challenges formed through illusions, loss, and truama, all of which must be handled by ones own mind. Sanity is how well you can keep your mind straight during great intensity such as strong illusions, heavy loss, or scarring events.

Abuse

Husks are built to survive until the last second, only making tasks harder yet not impossible until the husk is destroyed entirely. Abuse is your characters ability to take a hit in stride, ignoring their degrading form to function as normal. Abuse is most commonly found in combat, where a character can make an Abuse Skill Check to ignore some penalties of their wounds.

Resilience

Resilience is not an active skill, its your characters passive ability to soak a hit. Should an attack be made against them, characters with a higher Resilience will be able to ignore the damage. Resilience is not a characters ability to bounce back after injury and ignore their wounds, its their ability to not get hurt in the first place.
