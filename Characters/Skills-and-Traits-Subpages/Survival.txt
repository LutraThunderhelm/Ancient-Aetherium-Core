The ruins are a harsh enviroment and require a specific set of skills to venture in safely. Survival is a seet of skills needed for general survival and safety both among the Ruins and within Gredo's walls. Survival Skills let your character get through and prosper in harsher enviroments without skipping a beat. Suvival can also be seen as an enviromental resilience, providing the ability to escape the dangers you must face.

Survival is split into five skills: Perception, Navigation, Literacy, Stealth, and Improvisation. The inclusion of Literacy as a skill may seem strange, but learning how to read and write is seen as less than important in the training of new Bears. Literacy is instead a much more rarely learned skill that is either self taught, or passed down from high ranking literate bears in organizations like the Noble Seekers.
