Vitality is a measure of ones own resistance against the world. Standing at the brink of distruction, your character must know how to keep themselves together both physically and mentally to avoid the fate that stands before them. Covering both mental fortitude and physical limits, Vitality is critical to any bear who wishes to survive in the face of danger, mocking its attempts to show your character their own mortality.

Vitality itself is split into 4 skills: Bravery, Brawn, Sanity, and Abuse. Additionally, much like Handling and Evade, Vitality has a special passive skill that is never rolled, but instead used as a score to avoid damage called Resilience. Resilience is modified differently by Vitality than normal because of this, letting Vitality act as a shield against attempts to lower Resilience. At Vitality Level 7 effects that target your Resilience score cannot remove more than 4 Resilience. At Vitality Level 6 this bonus becomes half of your Resilience score rounded down, and at Level 5 the bonus only allow you to lose up to 1 point of Resilience.
