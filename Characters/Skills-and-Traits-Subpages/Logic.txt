Information processing is key to success in Gredo, paving the way for strong critical thought. Logic is a manifestation of ones control over their own mental process, their ability to break down and process information, as well as apply their higher knowledge. Logic covers the active side of a characters mind, letting them handle and use information through real time thoughts rather than inbuilt reactions. Simply put, Logic is your characters smarts.

Logic is split into four main skills: Operation, Academics, History, and Creation. These all cover specializations in your characters cognitive ability, though they do not cover everything. Should a character need to make a Skill Check that does not fit in the first four skills, it is assumed to be general cognitive challenge, and goes to the fith skill: Process.
