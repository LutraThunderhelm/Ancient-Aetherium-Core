Bears are magical contrusts made from arcane crystals gathered from an island full of mineral rich mountains. These Bears are given life through a single crystal known as their Mind Crystal. This crystal is the core of their being, holding their thoughts and memories as they travel through the world. Upon their creation Bears are tought basic skills such as the ability to walk and talk, before being let loose into one of the 7 castes, known as the 7 Rungs, where they will finish developing into their own unique self.

Bear culture is similar to human culture, but tends to be much more violent and dry. Bears don't deal in subtlety nor do they let others. Death is seen as more of a minor inconvenience or a swift solution to a problem, leading to combat and suffering being common tools of both control and rebellion. This leads Bears down a dark route of constant murder and violence over civil disputes, while keeping a calm manor the whole time.
