Perks are unique learned abilities that seperate a character from their peers. Perks are representative of specific abilities one has gained from their experiences in Gredo, allowing them unique ways to meet the challenges they face. Perks may be taken at any time both during, and after, character creation, as long as one has the correct amount of XP. The amount of XP a character may spend at character creation is dependant on their Social Rung. More Perks may be gained later with new XP, the rules for which may be found in Promotion.

Perks will have a number next to their name, this number is how much is costs for any single character to learn that Perk. Additionally, each Perk will have Backgrounds listed. These Backgrounds are especially familiar with that Perk and will need to use less XP to earn it, making the perk instead cost the amount that is in the parentheses, like this: (100). Should a character have 2 backgrounds required by the Perk, the Perk will cost even less, allowing it to be gained for the cost in the brackets, like this : [50]. Upon gaining a Perk, that ability will remain with the character unless something happens to remove the characters previous life experiences from their mind.
