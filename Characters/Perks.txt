Perks are unique learned abilities that seperate a character from their peers. Perks are representative of specific abilities one has gained from their experiences in Gredo, allowing them unique ways to meet the challenges they face. Perks will give your character a new set of tools to use throughout the world, with no cost to keep active, unlike a Passive Spell. New characters made during character creation will have 2 Perks availible to them to take for free.

Each perk will have a level listed, such as Level 1, Level 5, or Level 50. These levels represent how much experience is needed in the world of the Ancient Aetherium before your character can master those Perks. Characters being created for the first time are considered Level 1, and thus will only have access to Perks with Level 1 listed. Once your character advances up to Level 5 they will be ready for a new set of perks, letting them take any perk Level 5 or below, and so on with every Perk Level.

Additionally, each Perk will have 2 Backgrounds listed. These Backgrounds represent what past experiences may have lead to the aiblity to take that Perk, such as a Background in Creation allowing for one to take a perk to repair machines. When looking through Perks, any Perk that your character has no Background in common with is treated as 1 Level Set higher. This means Level 1 perks may only be used at Level 5, Level 5 perks may only be used at Level 10, Level 10 perks may only be used at Level 20, and so on. Level 50 Perks would reqiure your character to become Level 70 before being availible should your character have no Backgrounds in common.
