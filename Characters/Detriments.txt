Detriments are a characters unique personal flaws and failings. They represent lessons a character has not learned, or places they have fallen off in relation to those around them. Detriments help to make characters more well rounded, taking into account their strengths with Perks and their weaknesses with Detriments, making a character ready for the island of the Ancient Aetherium. Detriments are taken upon making a character, but may be gained at any point should the RM, or system, decide that the new Detriment fits the character's new struggles. Many Detriments do not include mechanical changes, instead giving new ways that character should be played, such as giving them the inability to keep a secret.

Detriments are not just for making rounded characters however. Detriments taken upon the characters creation will reward that character with XP, which may be used to purchase more Perks or Skills. Each Detriment will have a single value listed, which is the amount of XP given to a character for dealing with that Detriment. Should the character lose a Detriment by any means, they must pay back the rewarded XP fully in order to remove the Detriment, including Detriments gained after the character has been created.
