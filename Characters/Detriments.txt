Detriments are a characters unique personal flaws and failings. They represent lessons a character has not learned, or places they have fallen off in relation to those around them. Detriments help to make characters more well rounded, taking into account their strengths with Perks and their weaknesses with Detriments, making a character ready for the island of the Ancient Aetherium. Detriments are taken upon making a character, but may be gained at any point should the RM, or system, decide that the new Detriment fits the character's new struggles. Many Detriments do not include mechanical changes, instead giving new ways that character should be played, such as giving them the inability to keep a secret.

Detriments are not just for making rounded characters however. Detriments are taken upon the characters creation and must add to 5 total Reward. The value of each Detriment is located directly under the name.
