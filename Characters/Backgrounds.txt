Upon creation, a new Bear is left to form their understanding of the world off of their enviroment. Through common experiences in their past and present, they forge an identity and way of seeing everything around them. Backgrounds are mechanical representations of these past experiences. Every character created by a player will be assigned 2 Backgrounds to represent where they come from and what they know. The combination of these 2 Backgrounds should accurately represent a characters past as closely as possible, forming a complete image of their past experiences and how they effect that character now.

Once 3 Backgrounds have been picked, they cannot be changed. After character creation there will be no way to gain, lose, or alter the Backgrounds your Character has without supernatural intervention. Changing a Character's Background would change their history and their personal story to something no longer representative of themselves. Backgrounds themsleves are used to help a Character easily stay consistant with their core concept and principles. Backgrounds can make it easier to gain perks, follow gods, learn spells, and any other manner of development. All availible Backgrounds, and their Symbols, are listed below.
