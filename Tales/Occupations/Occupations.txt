Occupations are jobs given or sought out by Bears in Gredo and its Outposts. Occupations themselves don't tend to pay in currency, instead giving Bears the items reqiured to survive. Bears working as Firebugs wont see a single Artifact for their efforts, but they do get to loot Nauseas, get free supplies, and often times a place to lay low between operations. Occupations provide Bears with their overall purpose, their friends, and their necessities. Bears are often assigned to their Occupation upon leaving the Mentors, but some may become Citizens instead. Citizens have no inherient Occupation, instead being able to fill in for any Occupation as needed, should they be reassigned out of Citizenship.

Occupations may also be fluid. Prince's government sees value in passion for ones craft, allowing most Rungs (except the Workers) to easily move between different job titles quickly, letting most Bears assign themselves as they see fit. This structure is achieved by having no direct way to track an individual Bear to their job, instead using different Groups decide when they need more or less members. These groups then let members flow in or out as needed, and report the amount of members to the Noble Villa of Occupations, who will then attempt to use Citizens to fill remaining gaps.
