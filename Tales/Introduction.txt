Uh oh! Looks like the Tales page is currently down. You were likely linked here by another article referencing an important historical event, and if that is the case I apologize. The Tales of the Ancient Aetherium will be ready in the future, but it is currently being worked on in the background. If you would like updates on the state of the systems availible in Thunderhelm's Library, you can follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/ofStarsandVoid">official Twitter page</a> for more details.
