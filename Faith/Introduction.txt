The first 5 Bears ever created are known as the Founders, the builders of Gredo's civilization. These first five Bears where the only to be made by human hand, and the only to be given full access to the powers of the Aether. Their roles had been specialized into different domains of Gredo's culture, from war to knowledge, even to invention. As time slipped on these five Founders became immensely powerful over their domain, using the Aether to inact their will as they saw fit. Their domains grew, their powers expanded, and their memories became holy, turning the five Founders from five bears, into their five gods.

The Founders and their Apprentices are seen as deities, with legions of followers giving them power in exchange for favors known as Boons. Followers make a promise or do favors for their Founders and in return are offered favors from their Founder of choice who watches over them with a protective eye. The Founders are able to do this from any location at any time, as despite their physical state, the Aether gives them power over the entire Island. In this section you will find the 5 Founders and the 3 Apprentices, along with what they want in return for a fraction of their power.
