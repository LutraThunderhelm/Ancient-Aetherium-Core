/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Authorities tend to seek out Workers, intending to take them back to the Worker's Bastion. Axton does not want anything in the Bastion of his own creation, and refusing to let one return when commanded to results in gaining one of Axton's Boons.

Many minds can create many more ideas than one. Every time there is a request for the plans and designs behind something of ones own creation, and those plans are given over willingly at no cost, gain a Boon from your Promise of Collaberation.

Promise of Purity

Technologies harbored by the Hive are bleek and souless. Any time plans that require Computing Parts or Arco-Computing Parts that are planned for creation, are instead destroyed, gain one of Axton's Boons.
