	"description": "Named after the crystal known for producing ice, the Frigus Foundation constructs physical objects out of arcane origins. Positioned as one of the 6 Basic Foundations, the Frigus Foundation itself is open to anyone, allowing them small ways to create something from purely arcane sources. Frigus itself tends to be a route towards twisting the physical world or modifying it using purely arcane machinery. Additionally, despite their similar look to ice, Frigus objects are made from Arcane Ice, known for its strange structure. Arcane Ice quickly melts directly into the air, dissipating as steam unless its crystal structure is altered, turning it into a stable yet brittle material.",
