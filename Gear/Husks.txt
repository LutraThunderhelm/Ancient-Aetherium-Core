Unlike its peers, ones Husk is not a simple piece of equipment that may easily be replaced. Husks are manifestations of ones own physical form, also known as the body a bear's Mind Crystal pilots. Husks are much more permanent than Attire or Weapons, being the build of ones own body. Getting ones Husk to be a true version of themselves takes time and Artifact, but the end result is a tailored suit of power through which a lone Mind Crystal can accomplish anything.

Husks are Broken down into 16 parts. These 16 parts each corrispond to a Mind Channel, or a direct arcane input into ones own mind. Mind Channels may only have 1 Husk item attached at any time, as that item will occupy the entire Mind Channel until it is removed. These Channels may be occupied by anything the Bear wishes, from an Arm, to a Casting Core, to a full-ranged voice.

Additionally, unlike Attire, Weapons, or Kits, Husks are not kept track of using Cards, instead the Gear section of the Character Sheet keeps track of both the Durability of verious arcane organs, and their unique traits. This section of the Character Sheet should remain updated with any changes made to what occupies each channel, such as trading a Casting Core for an Arcane Core.
