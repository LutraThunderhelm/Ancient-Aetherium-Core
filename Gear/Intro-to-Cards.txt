Once you understand what an item is, it becomes important to denote Key Items. Key Items are items such as weapons, clothes, and kits, all of which will see regular use, will not be handed off easily, and will need to be kept track of by both Players and the Ruin Master. To aid with this, Key Items are given Item Cards, or small cards with all of the items details upon it, which may be used as reference and as a tool to keep track of the current status of the item. To use them, print, purchase, or otherwise obtain the card, then keep it out infront of the player.

This card will have the Item's Volume and the Item's Toughness upon it. The Volume of all items combined must not exceed a cap decided by the character's Clothing Attire, and with the Toughness being the same as described above. When an item is destroyed and await repair, it must be flipped over, making the details face down until usable. If the Item is completely destroyed or sold, the Item is removed from play.
