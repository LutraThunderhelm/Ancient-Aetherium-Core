Attire is a term for items worn by bears to help them carry other items, defend themselves, or keep themselves at the ready for anything. Attire is split into 3 layers of wearable equipment, the Clothing, Harness, and Armor. These 3 layers have unique attributes, increasing the amount one can carry, the amount of damage they can take, or equipment they hold quick access to. Attire serves the additional purpose of customizing the look of a character, giving them a unqiue outfit to carry through Gredo and the Ruins beyond.

Attire is split into 7 unique locations upon any given Husk: Tops, Pants, Hat, Waist, Back, Paws, and Feet. Each of these locations may have 3 pieces of Attire upon them, but only 1 from each sub category of Attire. The Top location may have a piece of Clothing and a piece of Armor, but it cannot have 2 pieces of Armor. Additionally, Attire may not be attacked as part of another attack. Attacks made against a Husk will ignore the Attire being worn on it, unless the Attire is specifically attacked instead of the Husk.
