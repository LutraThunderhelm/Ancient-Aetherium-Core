Kits used for Modification are common, as they allow other items to become much more efficient versions of themselves. Modification Kits are typically used for Weapons and Armor, allowing things for higher damage, or better resistance against attacks. Modification Kits may additionally be moved from item to item with no penalty, unless stated otherwise. Moving a Modification Kit off an item takes 2 Rounds or 10 seconds.
