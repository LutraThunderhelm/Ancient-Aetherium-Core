Disposable Kits are powerful tools only able to be used once before being lost forever. Disposable kits tend to be used to repair other items such as Armor Repair Packs, but they may also be consumable items, such as Brews. Unlike their peers, Disposable Kits are often not stored as cards, instead going on the Gear section of ones Character Sheet, as keeping track of custom Brews and all Disposable items may become tiresome.
