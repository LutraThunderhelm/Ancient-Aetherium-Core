While wandering through the Ancient Aetherium one may find themselves wanting to use a unique set of tools, such as a nail gun to build a barricade, or needles to stitch up a friend. These unique tools are bundled into Kits, or items with some unique purpose that may be used in specific enviroments to provide their user with a bonus. Attempting to seal a metal door to a metal frame is easier with a Welding Kit than with ones own paws, after all.

Kits come in 3 varities: Utility, Repair, and Modification. Utility kits are resuable sets of tools that may be used until they break, such as a Welding Kit, Steam Spiker, or Flashlight. Disposable Kits are used upon gaining their effects, such as a Brew, Armor Repair Pack, or Enchanted Threads. These items will become lost upon their effects taking place. Modification Kits change the behaviour of another Kit, Weapon, or piece of Clothing. Modification Kits are bound to the item they modify until they are purposefully removed or the item they are bound to its broken.
