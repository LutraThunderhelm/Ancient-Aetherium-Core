GUR Casting Cores
/Ancient-Aetherium-Core/placeholder.png
Standard issue Casting Cores, allowing the user to cast spells from one of the 6 Basic Foundations, and any Foundations derived from them. GUR Casting Cores tend to come in a set of 6, takings up 6 Mind Channels to use, however any GUR Casting Core may be removed at any time to gain a new Mind Channel. Removing a core means that the Husk user will no longer be able to use any magic from that Basic Foundation, nor any spells from Foundations based on that Foundation.

Arcane Core

Replacing Casting Cores or other limbs, Arcane Cores take 1 Mind Channel each, while providing 10 AB as long as the Torso remains intact. Arcane Cores are most often seen among highly specialized mages, providing them much more room to work with spells at the cost of spells they would never use.
