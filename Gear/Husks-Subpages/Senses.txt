Husk Senses are how well a Bear can perceive the world around them. Senses take Mind Channels to operate but unlike Limbs cannot be targeted and destroyed directly, instead having a chance to be broken when the Head is hit. the Head Limb is the location where all senses gather, being a pivot point that allows the Bear to direct their senses in any direction, other limbs are incapable of supporting Senses. Most Bears start with 3 sensory organs: a pair of Eyes, a Snout, and a pair of Ears.
