Limbs are extentions of ones mind into the physical world, providing the Mind Crystal with the proper tools to touch and meddle with the world around it as its sees fit. Most bears start life with 5 limbs: 2 arms, 2 legs, and 1 head. These limbs allow the Bear to move and interact with the world around them, but they aren't the only option when it comes to using a Mind Channel to reach into the physical world, just the most common ones. Limbs directly effect Movement, and Husk Toughness.
