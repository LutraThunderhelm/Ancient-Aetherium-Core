Eyes
/Ancient-Aetherium-Core/placeholder.png
The standard set of eyes found in every GUR or GUR based Husk. Allows the Bear to see the world through the light it gives off, as well as displaying a set of colored eyes that are capable of showing a large range of emotion. Not having a set of eyes results in the Sightless Status Effect, but gives back the 1 Mind Channel eyes occupy.

Ears
/Ancient-Aetherium-Core/placeholder.png
The standard set of ears found in every GUR or GUR based Husk. Ears help avoid the Earless Status Effect, allowing the Bear to hear everything around them. Without ears however, the Bear is able to use the 1 Mind Channel occupied by GUR Ears for another purpose.

Snout
/Ancient-Aetherium-Core/placeholder.png
The standard snout found in every GUR or GUR based Husk. The snout holds both the nose and mouth, meaning that without it a Bear gains the Snoutless Status Effect, meaning they cannot speak, smell, or consume brews. Removing the snout gives back the 1 Mind Channel it occupies.
