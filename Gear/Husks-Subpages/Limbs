Guilded Union Redux (GUR)
/Ancient-Aetherium-Core/placeholder.png
The GUR Husk is the result of many Guilds being brought together to create the next form of standard Husk. Being the standard, almost every bear in the Ancient Aetherium use the GUR as their Husk of choice, letting its well rounded durability and movement push them forward through the island. Because of this, the GUR is what is automatically filled in on all character sheets, with other Husk Limbs being modifications of the GUR rather than stand alone Husks.

Iron Skinned Husk

Known for their use by Foremen in the Worker's Bastion, Iron Skinned Limbs are built to imprison a mind rather than aid it. Every Iron Skinned Limb recieves +3 Toughness compared to the GUR, however for every Iron Skinned Limb, Movement is reduced by 1 (Hands and Arms are counted as a single limb for movement penalties). Additionally, the Iron Skinned Torso always has the Exposed Status Effect.
