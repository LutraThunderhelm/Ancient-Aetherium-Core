Casting Husk organs are responsible for allowing a bear access to the Arcane Star, as well as their initial AB. Casting organs are found among the Torso directly surrounding the Mind Crystal, feeding from its direction to help the user cast spells from their Arcane Bank. Casting Organs may only be located in the Torso due to their size, and cannot be targeted by attacks. Casting Husk Organs are unable to be directly damaged, having no durability, but instead being broken upon the Torso being broken, combining their status with that of the Husk Torsos.
