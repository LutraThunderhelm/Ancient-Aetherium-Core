One of the first weapons ever weilded by a Bear, Boomstick Firing Weapons are old world gunpowder based guns, named before the word "gun" was widely known. Boomstick Firing Weapons are a niche category of firearm known for their extremely high damage, and extremely rare ammunition. Unlike Ruckster Firing Weapons or Rifle Firing Weapons, Boomstick Firing Weapons have a limited supply of old world ammunition, as no group in Gredo has created an automated system for creating new ammunition. Their rarity and the rarity of their ammunition makes Boomstick Firing Weapons expensive guns to use and maintain, but worth every Artifact.

Boomstick Firing Weapons have a unique Ammo score. Every weapon has a unique chambering and round needed to fill it, making the price to fill a gun different from weapon to weapon. The Ammo score keeps track of the average price of each weapons unique ammunition. Additionally, each gun will have a Clip score. The Clip is how many bullets may be fired before a 1 Full Action reload must take place.
