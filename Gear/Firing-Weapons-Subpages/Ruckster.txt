Named after the creator of the Muck Core, Ruckster Firing Weapons are high powered and extremely volatile firearms known for breaking down seemingly at random. Generally very unreliable, Ruckster Firing Weapons harness the self destructive power of Muck Cores in order to create harsh beams of arcana, capable of peircing armor and weapons to cause as much damage as possible.

Ruckster Firing Weapons have a unique score known as their Rate of Decay (RoD). When a Ruckster Firing Weapon is used there is a chance the Muck Core powering the firearm will break. The chance of the Muck Core breaking is decided by rolling a seperate D100, and if that D100 lands under the Rate of Decay score, the Muck Core shatters, and must be replaced. Replacing a broken Muck Core takes typically 2 Rounds or 10 seconds.
