Ballista Firing Weapons are explosive weapons of mass destruction, named after the misunderstanding of a human invention. Ballista Firing Weapons encompass any explosive device, from grenades, to rocket launchers, to landmines. Because of their explosive nature each Ballista Firing Weapon is given a Fuse and a Radius. The Fuse is the Ballistas triggering mechanism, such as wiating 5 seconds, or detonating upon impact. Radius is how big the explosion is, making the explosion effect everything within the Radius, with the Radius being in meters.
