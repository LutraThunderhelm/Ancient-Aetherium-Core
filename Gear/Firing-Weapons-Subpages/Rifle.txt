Relatively young compared to its more tried and tested peers, Rifle Firing Weapons are an attempt by the Inventor's Guild to rival the effectiveness of Boomsticks and Ruckster Rifles by making a gun with easily mass producable ammunition. Known more commonly by the name Steam Rifles, Rifle Firing Weapons use steam to shoot small projectiles forwards towards an enemy. This allows Steam Rifles to be dependable and allows their ammunition to be mass producable, making most Rifle Firing Weapons automatic in nature. 

Because of their automatic nature, Rifle Firing Weapons will have a Rate of Fire (RoF) die. Upon being used during a Firing Skill Check, an amount of ammunition equal to the maximum number of the die is used. The RoF die is then rolled, with that many projectiles hitting the target. Every projectile that hits acts as individual damage from all other projectiles that hit. Additionally, Rifle Firing Weapons use a Drum score, which is the amount of ammunition that can be spent before the Rifle Firing Weapon needs to be reloaded, which typically takes 1 Full Action.
