Firing Weapons are long range hand-steadied damaging items, allowing the user to have a safe distance from any violent action while still being part of it. Firing Weapons tend to use Firing Skill Checks to make an attack, and may take a Half Action to Aim. Aiming a Firing Weapon provides a +1 to all dice rolled during a Firing Skill Check to fire that weapon. Firing Weapons tend to have longer range but lower damage then their Brawling Weapon counterparts, trading pain for safety.

Firing Weapons come in many types from many eras, from modern guns, to medieval crossbows, to beams of pure arcane energy. These sub categories change how one uses the Firing Weapon, tailoring its mechanics and ammunition, such as changing effects per Crossbow bolt, or potentially firing forever. These new effects and categories are listed below, along with a table of avalible example weapons in that category, and their costs.
