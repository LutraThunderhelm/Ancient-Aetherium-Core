Powered Brawling Weapons are characterized by having highly deadly effects when damage is dealt, at the expense of maintenance. Powered Brawling Weapons will have a fuel type, like oil, steam, or crystals, which are consumed over time. Every time the item is used it consumes a Charge, which is the fuel it takes for a single attack. Different machines have a different amount of Charges they gain from a single unit of fuel, and will need to be refueled when their Charges run out. Powered Brawling Weapons are listed below. All weapons are assumed to be one handed unless stated otherwise.
