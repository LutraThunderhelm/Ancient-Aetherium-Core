Gauntlet Brawling Weapons are worn weapons in the style of bladed armors, such as gloves with sharpened finger tips. These weapons serve two purposes: providing a means of offense through bladed attacks, and a means of defense by using the armored section of the weapon. Because of their unique fighting style, Gauntlet Brawling Weapons allow the wielder of the weapon to block incoming attacks by rolling the weapons Damage, and using half of it as Toughness against the next attack made on them.
