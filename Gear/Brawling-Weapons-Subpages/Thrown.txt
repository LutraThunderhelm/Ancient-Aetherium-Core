Many weapons could be thrown, but Thrown Brawling Weapons are built to be. From hand axes, to throwing knives, to blades chained to their owner, Thrown Brawling Weapons cover a wide range of items with the intention to be hurled at great velocity towards and enemy to cause the most pain possible. Thrown Brawling Weapons must be picked up after hitting their target, and must use an Acrobatics Skill Check instead of a Brawling Skill Check in order to hit an enemy.
