Breaker Brawling Weapons are known for their pure destructive capabilities. Breaker weapons are designed around the idea of leveling a fight by destroying the power of the stronger party, ripping through Toughness and items like they're made of paper. Due to their ability to crack through metal armors and items, Breaker Brawling Weapons tend to hand poor damage output, being stronger weapons of supportive destruction than the solo heros of combat. Additionally, Breaker Brawling Weapns need to hand s to weild, unless stated otherwise. Breaking Brawler Weapons also tend to be Heavy, requiring a specific Brawn Skill Level to weild, otherwise being unusable.
