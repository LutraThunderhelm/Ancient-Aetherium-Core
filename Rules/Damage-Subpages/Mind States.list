Cracked
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
When your Torso runs out of Durability, the next hit on it will send your character into a Cracked Mind State. Characterized by the literal cracking open of one's own mind, this is the last stand between a Bear and their death. While in the Cracked Mind State, every turn taken by the Bear must be started by an Abuse Skill Check, with a target of 2, with a +1 for every previously failed Cracked Mind State related Abuse Skill Check. Should the Bear fail their Abuse Skill Check, their turn instead goes to the RM, who must use the character to destroy any sources of magic around them, including machines and other Bears. Additionally, in the Cracked Mind State, your Mind Crystal gains 3 Durability and the Exposed Status Effect. Should your Mind Crystal lose all of its Durability, changed to the Shattered Mind State. If your Mind Crystal manages to be repaired, change to the Fractured Mind State.

Shattered

Once a Mind Crystal shatters, there is nothing more. Sometimes referred to as The End, the Shattered Mind State takes place when one mind fully breaks apart into several pieces, unable to be repaired by even the most experienced mage. Once one shatters they are permanently removed from play.

Fractured

Sometimes you will be able to survive a brief brush with death, becoming Fractured. Once one's mind cracks they can never be the same as they once were, even if they can get their sanity back. Fractured are the leftovers of being near The End that can carry through the rest of a lifetime. These leftovers often warp one's perception of the reality around them, changing how they interpret the world. If your character is able to successfully recover from the Cracked Mind State, they must take on the Fractured Mind State. While in the Fractured Mind State, gain a new Fracture trait, and move the Process, Perception, Sanity and Insight skills under it. All Skills and Traits  retain their previous level. After you have made the Fractured Trait, pick 1 Fractured Perception.
