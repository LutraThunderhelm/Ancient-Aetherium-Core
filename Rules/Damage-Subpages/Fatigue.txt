Unlike organic creatures, Bears have no need to eat, but instead gain energy from crystal based power networks in most places with a relation to Gredo. While in these areas their bodies can take in the arcane power in the environment, but while away from these locations, things get a little more complicated. Fatigue is a measure of how long your character has been away from an arcane source of power. After 8 hours of being isolated from a power source your character will enter the Tired Mind State, at which point the RM should remind the players of their current time away from a source of power. After another 8 hours without power, your character will enter the Exhausted Mind State. Once another 8 hours have passed, your character will collapse and enter the Dormant Mind State. To reverse the effects of Fatigue, simply spend time in an area with arcane power. Every 4 hours will raise your Fatigue by 1 Mind State while awake, and every 2 hours will raise 1 Mind State  while asleep.
