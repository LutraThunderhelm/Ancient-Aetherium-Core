Tired
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Bears need a constant supply of arcane power to keep moving. Not getting this power results in the character gaining the Tired Mind State. The Tired Mind State is given after a character is away from a source of arcane power, such as an Outpost, for over 8 hours. While tired, your character must reroll the highest number of any dice pool during any check.

Exhausted

Should a character become tired and still remain away from a source of power, that character becomes Exhausted. The Exhausted Mind State is given after 16 hours away from a source of power, resulting in the character taking -2 Levels in all Skills during Skill Checks until they are no longer Exhausted, as their body is shutting down from lack of power.

Dormant
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
After 24 hours away from Civilization, the character can no longer keep moving. Their body has syphoned the last bit of available energy it had left, leaving your characters Husk and mind Dormant. Dormant bears are not quite dead or Shattered, but they are permanently incompacitated unless they can get energy again. Once a Dormant bear is given power again, they can keep functioning as normal.
