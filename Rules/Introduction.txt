The main goal of the Ancient Aetherium is to give the players and Ruin Master the proper tools to tell a story together in a time of teddy bear and magic filled chaos. This can be a daunting task for the RM and players to do without structure, so the Ancient Aetherium comes with a set of rules to help guide the game and story as the group sees fit. These rules can be situational, such as asking for a character to prove their skill with a Skill Check, or they can be part of the core cycle of the game, such as Combat and Navigation. Above all however, the rules in this section are merely a suggestion, and the RM retains the power to bend and twist them however they see fit to tell the right story as they see fit, also known as Home Ruling.

Additionally, the pages containing the rules may be large and not immedietly navigatable, as they are meant to cover every aspect of their part of the game. Should there be a disagreement over the rules, it is suggested that the RM makes a temporary rule in its place until the real rules can be referenced to keep the game moving, unless the party wishes to put a small stop on the game for the sake of accuracy. There may be sections that seem incomplete as well, and if the group encounters a situation not covered in the stated rule set, they are encouraged to improvise a set of rules in its place to keep the game moving. Should the section be critical to play and yet still missing, it is suggested that you contact the author of this page so they may adopt the rule set appropriately.
