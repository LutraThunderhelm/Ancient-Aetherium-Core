Production is the process of taking a plan, parts, and throwing them together into a complete Invention. Completing an Invention requires the proper assembly, combining the Complexity of the Invention with the Difficulty of its base, Production requires a streak of Operation Skill Checks to succeed in order to create the invention, failing at any step meaning the loss of the most expensive part. To Produce an Invention make an amount of Operation Skill Checks equal to the Complexity of the Active Effect of the invention, all with the Difficulty of the Invention Base. These Skill Checks may be done with time passing between attempts, such as spreading a Complexity of 4 over 4 days, or they may be done all at once. Upon completion the Invention is ready for use.

Additives are added after the fact, with each Addative being added with a single Operation Skill Check with a difficulty decided by the Additive. Success adds the effect of the Additive, while failiure loses the parts needed to create the Additive.
