The most critical part of any Invention is the plans used to make it. Inventions must be properlly planned to survive its constant us, or they may breakdown quickly. Planning itself is broken down into 3 parts: Invention Base, Active Elements, and Additives. The Invention Base is the form your invention takes. Is it a rifle? Maybe a bomb? Maybe its an augment to a husk? Or is it simply just a bottle? Inventions need a basic shell and design that decides the durability, and uses the invention will have. Active Elements are a shorthand for what the Invention will do. Will it explode, or does it show enemies? Maybe instead the Invention changes your voice? Active elements decide the stability and function of any Invention. Additives simply give more use to an invention, such as increasing firing speed of a rifle, or fuse time of a bottle grenade.

While the Invention Base, Active Element, and Additives can be anything the inventor wants, examples of each including their stats, part requirements, and functions are below to give an idea of the relationships between different concepts and their costs. Once the planning stage is done, move onto the parts stage.
