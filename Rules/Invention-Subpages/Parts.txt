All inventions are made from something, and based on the Plans made during the previous step, its now time to find Parts! Parts are non-specific types of material used to create Inventions, with each part of an Invention requiring a specific set of parts. These parts can be anything that matches the description of the set of parts, as long as they are usable. An old bronze pipe may count as a Bronze Part, but a pile of bronze metal shavings may need work before they can become part of any Invention. Once all the parts have been gathered, move on to Production to finish the invention!
