Bronze Parts

Bronze and copper are alloys commonly used in arcane machinery, as combining them with Red Carbon makes them amazing for containing the flow of Arcana. Red copper pipes and red bronze plating is in almost every Invention. Despite their names, they do not appear red, unlike red carbon itself. Most if not all copper and bronze ins circulation is the red variant.

Clockwork Parts

Gears and moving pieces, powered by small arcane power cores. Typcially found in old mechanical furniture and in complex inventions. Clockwork Parts are needed for machines with larger mechanical complexity, making up their intricate functions.

Arcane Parts

Arcane Parts are directly powered arcane crystals meant to serve a purpose inside the Invention. Arcane Parts tend to be the crystals themselves, or piles of arcane based powders, providing similar functionality to their complete counterparts. Arcane Parts tend to be more unstable as well, introducting direct arcane forces into a mechanical space.

Computing Parts

Both illegal and taboo in all walks of life, Computing Parts are electronic circuitry used for automation. More "smart" Inventions will tend to require Computing Parts to process their automation. Without Computing Parts, automatic machines are impossible. Computing Parts most commonly come from old world computers, as most Hive Droids will be too damaged to salvage.

Arco-Computing Parts

Arco-Computing comes from the use of arcane sources to power computing devices. Typically flashy and over the top, Arco-Computing is much more powerful and required for automatic heavy machinery, or complex auto machinery. Arco-Computing parts can only be found on Hive Droids and Hive Engines, who will tend to be too damage to salvage. Arco-Computing parts may also be found in Hive facilities.

Salvaged Parts

Salvaged Parts are never required, instead filling the void another part leaves. Forget a bronze container for a reusable explosive, combine some space arcane powder in a glass bottle for a 1 time grenade. Salvaged Parts are found in all enviroments and can replace any part listed above in an invention. In trade, that part breaks after a single use, no matter what. For every part being replaced, +1 difficulty is added to a Creation Skill Check, which is required to pass in order to use Salvaged Parts.
