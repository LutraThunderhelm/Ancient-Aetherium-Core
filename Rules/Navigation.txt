When a party needs to get through anywhere, from and old city center, to a bustling town full of merchants, they will typically need to make a Navigation Check. Navigation Checks represent the party's overall ability to get around an area without attracting trouble or losing time. When a party needs to make a Navigation Check, take out a deck of 54 standard playing cards. Shuffle the deck and lay down an amount of cards equal to the amount of characters involved. After this point all characters involved will make a Navigation Skill Check, with every success removing 1 card, and every character with no successes adding 2 cards. 

Once the final card total is made, pick up the remaining cards, find the highest value card, and refer to the encounter table in the chosen Land Type. After the results have been found the RM may chose to reveal the card or keep it hidden. If no cards are available after the players had made the Navigation Skill Check, assume no encounters happen. The amount of cards, the Difficulty to remove a card, and the Encounter Table are split into 3 sections that are chosen by the RM to fit the environment that the party is attempting to navigate. These sections are broken down into Density, Type, and Population.
