One of the largest parts of Gredo's leisure culture is its reliance on mind altering substances known as Brews. Brews are drinks made from normal beverage Bases such as water, alcohol, or coffee, and modified with crystaline Mixins, giving them mind and body altering effects. Brews are a staple of Gredo and its Outposts, with bars that serve these drinks being the center of social interactions, letting their Bartenders quickly become social leaders of their communities. Brews often have a secondary effect of causing bears to puke anything unused several hours after consumption. This byproduct is often a mix of vibrant colors, leading to large parties causing whats known as Rainbow Roads, or roads covered in Brew byproduct.

Brews are dangerous substances to mess with, but fun none the less. When one attempts to make a brew they need 3 parts. First is a Base, or the human drink the Brew is based on. These Bases serve to be the catalyst for the Brew's effects, with a verying range of mechanics defined in a list below. Once the Base is chosen, the Mixins decide the nature of the Brew. Does it mend wounds? Does it make one lose their mind? Does it give them a stronger focus? Mixins give both main effects and side effects each, and must be balanced out accordingly. Third is the Bottle, or how the brew is distributed. The Bottle decides if a brew is thrown, airborne, or drank with different systems needed to use each.

Upon the seperate parts coming together, one may make a brew with the proper Arco-Chemistry station, found in the back of most Bars. These stations provide all the tools as long as the right materials are available to create the brew. Making a brew requires the creator to pass an Academics Skill Check with +1 Difficulty for every aspect of the Brew. (This includes Base and Bottle). Upon a success the Brew is created and the materials are consumed. Upon a failiure however, the materials are consumed and Arco-Slag is created instead.
