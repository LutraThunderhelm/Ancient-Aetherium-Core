Unlike other rule sections, Situational Rules have no clearly defined time to be used. Skill Checks, Fear Checks, and Insanity Checks must be leveraged by the RM when they see fit. Combat rules will start to apply in a fight, but it is up to the RM to decide what situation requires a player to prove their characters abilities, when a character encounters something that would trigger a fight or flight response, or when a character encounters something that would drive them to the point of madness. These checks should be considered part of the RM's toolkit to use at any point to add mechanical effects to important parts of the story.
