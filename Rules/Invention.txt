While spellcraft is a large part of Gredo's culture, its mechanical heart beats loud. Inventions surround Gredo in a shroud of bronze, copper, piping, and arcana. Using their newfound arcane physics, Inventors are able to push the bounds of what was once possible with basic clockwork machinery, forming a culture around steam and arcane machines using a copper based alloy to direct the flow of magic through a machanical heart. Everything from a husk, to its weapon, to the mech it may pilot is considered a machine. Many premade machines come directly from the assembly line powered by the Working Rung in the Worker's Bastion. These machines are powerful, but tailoring ones own machines is a skill that will never fail them.

Inventions are broken down into 4 categories: Plans, Parts, Production, and Premades. Creating an invention to last will require indepth planning, the right parts, and assembling them well. Creating an invention in the heat of the moment however, just requires the right parts around you, a hasty plan, and some fast paws. Invention could be an elegant art or a cobbled together tool of survival, as long as it follows the first three Ps. Premades however, are simply the blueprints of already existing Inventions. Inventors don't reinvent the wheel unless they need to, and Premades should give the RM and their players a feeling for the costs behind machinery.
