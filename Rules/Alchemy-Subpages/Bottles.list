/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Liquid Bottles are built to be consumed. Liquid Bottles only have their effects take place when one drinks it willingly, activating upon the target doing so. Liquid Bottles may be stored in anything that can store normal liquids such as cups, bowls, plastic bags, or barrels.

Seeping Bottle
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Seeping Bottles are used when a brew needs to be consumed by some target but that target cannot or will not drink it. Seeping Bottles are thrown and splashed onto a target using an Acrobatics Skill Check against their Evade Score, if the target attempts to dodge it. Upon making contact the Brew soaks into the target and actives its effects. Seeping Bottles must be held in glass containers.

Steam Bottle

Steam Bottles tend to linger over a 3 by 3 meter area, affecting any enemy that is in that area for the next 15 seconds, or 3 rounds. Steam Bottles must be held in pressurized containers built to store gasses.
