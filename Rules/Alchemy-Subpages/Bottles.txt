Below is a list of commonly used Bottles, or ways that the Brew may be delivered. Bottles themselves are very general, and may have physical traits change from Bottle to Bottle. This happens despite being used the same way, such as putting a Liquid Bottle into a mug, or small packet. Because of their nature, Bottles do not require specific parts, instead requiring some Item able to hold them, such as having an old beer bottle for a Liquid Bottled Brew, gas tanks for a Steam Bottled Brew or hose for Seeping Bottled Brew.
