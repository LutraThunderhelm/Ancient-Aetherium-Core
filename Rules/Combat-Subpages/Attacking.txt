Making a successful attack is more complicated then simply "punching 'em in the face." Attacks are 2 step processes, breaking down into connecting the attack and dealing the damage. To make an attack, one must target the enemy in the range of their weapon, and choose to attack them. The attacker then makes a Firing or Brawling Skill Check depending on the weapon, but instead of counting successes, they total the value of the dice, with each die having the value of its roll result with 3 less than the attackers Handling Trait Level subtracted. This ending score is compared to the enemies Evade Score, with an attack roll with a higher value meaning the attack connects and is able to do damage.

Damage is weapon dependant, with each one having a unique way to calculate damage dealt. Once that damage is rolled and totaled however, it is compared to the targets Toughness Score on the target body part. Should the damage be higher than the score, that body part loses a Durability (see the Damage section for more on Durability). If the damage exceeds the targets Toughness by an amount equal to the targets Resiliance Score, an additional Durability is taken from the target. This effect may happen multiple times.

During the step of connecting the attack, it is also possible that the target may wish to Deflect the attack. Typically this means Dodging the incoming attack, which is done by rolling a Deflection Skill Check, and comparing the would-be successes of the attackers Brawling or Firing Skill Check. Should the target have more successes they successfully dodge the attack. This takes a Half Action to preform.
