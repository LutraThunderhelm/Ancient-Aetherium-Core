Basic Starter

Combat starts with drawing cards and starting a basic Turn Order. There are no special conditions or phantom Round 0s to keep track of during a Basic Starter, only the start of combat itself. The Basic Starter assume both parties see the fight coming.

Suprising Starter

Any time a group is caught off gaurd by the other, they are the victims of the Suprising Starter. Suprising Starters exist in a situation where one party starts combat without the other party being aware that combat was about to start, and as a result are caught out by the violence. The Suprising Starter causes a Round 0, where the party preforming the Suprising Starter draw their cards and take their turns, but the victims do not and cannot participate in Round 0. Upon Round 0 ending, the remaining cards are drawn and combat resumes as normal.

Unprepared Addendum

The Uprepared Addendum is a modification of the Suprising Starter where the victims suffer a -1 success to all Actions taken during their turns until they make a Process Skill Check with a Difficulty of 1 in order to gather their minds and items to meet combat. The Uprepared Addendum is for a victim party that is not only not expecting combat, but is also not currently in a combat ready state to begin with.
