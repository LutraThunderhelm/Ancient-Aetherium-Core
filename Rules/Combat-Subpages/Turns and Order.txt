Rounds are broken down into Turns. This can be thought of as organizing who does what in the 5 second chunk of time, before moving on to the next 5 seconds. During the start of combat, all players and the RM should recieve a card for all characters they control. For the RM it may be a good idea to group up similar enemies into a single turn to keep the game moving. Additionally, any character or construct that is quoted as "moving with another" takes their turn together with the one they are linked to. Upon all necessary cards being handed out, they may be flipped over. These cards decide the turn order.

During Combat, the RM should take control and locate the highest card using this system, with the highest value card listed first: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Numbers (in order from 10 down to 2). Additionally, should 2 characters have the same value, the suit determines the tie breaker in this order of highest value listed first: Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs. The character with the highest card take their turn first, the character with the second highest card goes second, and so on until the lowest card goes last. Upon the final card taking their turn, the Round is over, and the Combat moves to the next 5 seconds. Without drawing new cards, count down again in the same style of the first round and repeat until combat concludes. Combat ends once there is no one willing to fight due to death, peaceful termination, a larger threat, etc.
