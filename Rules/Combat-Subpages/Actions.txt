Actions are the life and blood that makes up combat. Actions represent what can be done in the span of a Round, from attacking an enemy to casting a spell, Actions represent what your character can actually do. Generally, it is assumed that every character is able to preform 1 Action while in combat, unless they have an effect that states otherwise. Additionally, all characters are allowed an additional Half of an Action that is considered an Unbound Action. Unbound Actions are not required to be taken during a Turn, and can instead be taken at any time, though this can include being taken on ones turn. Like normal Turn bound Actions, once a new Round starts, all characters regain their Unbound Action. The types of Actions are listed below, along with what they can be used for.
