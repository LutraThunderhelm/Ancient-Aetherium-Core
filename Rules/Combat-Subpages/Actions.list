Full Action

Full Actions take 1 Action to perform, and are typically larger in scale. The most common types of Full Actions are making an Attack, cast Full Action Spells, Barricade, or use most Kits. Additionally, any Full Action may be broken down into 2 Half Actions.

Half Action

Half Actions are smaller parts of combat that still may take additional time or focus to preform. 2 Half Actions may be taken in the place of any Action. Half Actions include: sprinting to take a second Movement Action, using an item, or talking. Additionally, a Half Action may be taken to ready an attack. This causes the character to lose 1 Action from their next turn, but gain 1 Full Unbound Action in its place.

Unbound Action

As mentioned above, Unbound Actions are taken outside of normal turns, including during another characters turn. Unbound Actions may also be used to deflect an attack using various skills based on the Deflection Skill. More information on deflection is available in the Attacking page.

Instant Action

Instant Actions take no time to preform, and have no Action Cost or no focus to do during Combat. Instant actions tend to be small or passive, such as dropping an item, making a check to remove a Fear Effect, or resisting an Insanity Check as an Unbound Instant Action.

Movement Action

Movement Actions exist outside of other Actions. Movement Actions do not cost an Action to perform, but allow the character to move according to their Movement Score. This Movement may still only be preformed during a characters Turn, and may only be taken once without Action Cost, otherwise costing a Half Action to move.
