Fight starters are not specifically the style of starting a fight, such as calling another a "bitch," but instead are a method of altering the Turn Order in response to these contexts. Fights started suddenly with no warning are a lot more beneficial to the instigating party than the party caught out. Fight Starts change how the start of Combat responds to specific situations and should only be altered from the base Fight Starter if they specifically apply, instead of picking a Fight Starter for every instance of Combat.
