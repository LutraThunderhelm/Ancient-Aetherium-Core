Damage is an important part of the Ancient Aetherium. Specifically, damage keeps track of the functional state of both ones husk and ones equipment, as well as keeping track of ones mental state and exhaustion. Damage is the ultimate tool to keep track of the physical capabilities of any one character. Direct physical damage tends to effect Durability, damage directly to ones mind crystal triggers a related Mind State, nad going too long without an Outpost or the city itself will result in Fatigue.
