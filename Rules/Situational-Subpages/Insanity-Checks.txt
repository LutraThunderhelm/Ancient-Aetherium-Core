Mental heatlh is entirely ignored by Gredo's culture leading to build ups of mental strain, which under the right situations can come crashing down. Insanity Checks are built for situations with a large mental toll, whether its witnessing something that drives someone mad, or simply the stress of losing someone close. Insanity Checks may also be taken by non-player characters, however it is likely to have the most impact on player controlled characters.
                        
Insanity Checks are specialized Skill Checks, requiring a test of ones ability to keep their mind together using Sanity. When the RM sees fit and asks for a character to make an Insanity Check, the player must make a Sanity Skill Check with an assumed difficulty of 2, unless stated otherwise by the RM. Should the player succeed, their character keeps their composure and suffers no effects, but if they fail they must take an Insanity Effect from the Insanity Effect table below. Insanity Effects tend to be more severe than Fear Effects, and may even be permanent, so use of Insanity Checks should be taken with great care.
