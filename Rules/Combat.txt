The heart of this island is violent. Home to an eternal war, and a faction of non-stop in fighting, its unlikely a single day will go by without violent interference. This violence has worked its way into Gredo's law, culture, social structures, and the very fabric of its individuality. Additionally, its violent tendencies have worked their way into the Ancient Aetherium System, where it serves an equally important purpose. Combat should not be avoided by the bears in Gredo, and this section aims to give order to a situation of disorder.

Combat in the Ancient Aetherium is broken down into 5 second Rounds. In this 5 second fraction of time, everyone involved with the current combat will get a chance to effect the tide of battle through their own strengths and weaknesses. This is done by using a Turn Order and giving each character a set of Actions, both of which are described below. It is generally assumed in this section that Players will only be controlling their Player Characters, while the Ruin Master controls both the enemies and allies of the Player Characters.
