Arcane City Center
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Arcane Land Types typically cover areas own by Gredo, or bears that once belonged to Gredo. Arcane City Centers are often friendly areas controlled directly by Gredo's governing power. These areas will typically not see direct trouble, but instead have social deviants lurking in the shadows.

Arcane Borderlands
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
The areas surrounding Arcane City Centers are often considered to be Arcane Borderlands. Referring to an area secured by Gredo's people through one reason or another, Borderlands are characterized by scavenging, looting, and a large number of Residents. Typically Outposts will also count as Arcane Borderlands.

Arcane Holdout
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Traitors often find themselves setting in strange parts of the Ruins in an attempt to avoid gaining any attention from Gredo's forces. Known as Arcane Holdouts, these areas tend to seem quieter than they really are, with the Traitors lurking around corners the party may not be aware of.

Nauseous Heart
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Nauseas are areas covered in a thick green gas known to cause hallucinogenic effects in bears by acting on them the same way brews do. Should a bear be without a bandana or other way to cover their snout for a long enough time they may start to see things in the nauseous gas. Nauseous Hearts are areas fully infested by Nauseous plants and animals, which are rapidly mutating creatures with a thirst for arcane power, as its what keeps them alive.

Nauseous Borderlands
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
The Nauseous Borderlands are similar to their Nauseous Heart counterparts, but instead cover the area close to a nausea. While being out of the gas may deter many wandering creatures, others tend to find themselves able to drag unexpecting ruiners back into Nauseous Nests.

Fields of Fire
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Fields of Fire refer to active combat zones. Areas under heavy fire from both Gredo and the Hive alike will often have seen enough destructive combat that the buildings that used to provide cover have all been blasted away. Navigating Fields of Fire often involve risking one's own life to run across active warzones, hoping one doesn't get hit.

Fields of Ash
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Once the fire of the fight has died down, all that's left is a Field of Ash. Filled with the smokey corpse of what once was, Fields of Ash occur once Gredo or the Hive has taken control of a Field of Fire. While the battling may be done however, many artifacts of war can still be found among the remains.

Field Borderlands

Hive Core
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png

Hive Borderlands

The second most dangerous place for any one citizen of Gredo to be, the Outskirts of Hive controlled territory is often patrolled by the Hives various drones and engines out the lookout for those that dare try and venture through their territory. Often times attracted the attention of just one petrol group will cause others in the area to begin making their way to the intruders.
