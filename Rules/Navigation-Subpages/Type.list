(1 Success) Industrial
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Industrial Environments only require 1 success to remove a card. The old world's industrial districts were ruthlessly efficient at moving material, made to be almost mindlessly easy to get through. 250 years down the road, the money spent on the ruthless efficiency can still be seen. Comprised of gridlocked factories, warehouses, and depots, many prominent landmarks were built to pierce the low skyline making them easy to use as reference.

(2 Success) Countryside

Countrysides require 2 successes to remove a card. Once filled with farms, fields, and pastures, the countryside of the Ancient Aetherium is now filled with long fields of dust and cracked dirt. The only buildings on the horizon are small farmsteads or residential homes. With winding roads and hard to spot landmarks, Countrysides end up being harder to navigate than Industrial Districts.

(3 Success) Residential

Residential Districts require 3 successes to remove a card. One of the most common ruin locations, Residential districts are made of broken down suburbs, apartments, and small business centers for family stores. Often the most common looting location, most Outposts will setup in Residential districts to take advantage of the already existing infrastructure without worrying about the maze that makes up most Downtowns.

(4 Success) Woodlands

Woodlands require 4 successes to remove a card. The corpses of old world plantlife have long since rotted away, with plant life in Gredo being made up of the byproduct of Nauseas. Woodlands are comprised of the aftermath from Nauseas, with dense possibly dead plantlife blocking major routes of travel and tearing down buildings in a chaotic unorganized mess.

(5 Success) Downtown
/Ancient-Aetherium/placeholder.png
Downtowns require 5 successes to remove a card. With buildings that once pierced the sky, and subways that stretched for miles, Downtowns are a sight to behold. Originally made as busy commercial districts, the 250 year old Downtowns have fallen to the wear of the years, filling the streets with rubble and the corpses of fallen sky scrapers. Most downtowns can no longer use their ground levels, with navigation being restricted to scaffolding along rooftops and through old decaying upper floors, avoiding the ocean of rock and ash below.
